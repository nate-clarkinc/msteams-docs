    Microsoft Teams calling and meeting bot provides basic functionalities such as create a call, join a call, transfer or redirect a call, join a scheduled meeting, and invite the participants by integrating the cloud communications Graph API.
    
    Bots can interact with Teams calls and meetings using real time voice, video, and screen sharing. With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can interact with users using voice and video to enhance their experience. These APIs allow you to add the following new features:

    * Use Interactive Voice Response (IVR).
    * Use call control.
    * Provide access to real time audio and video streams, including desktop and app sharing.

    Create a bot and specify additional information and permissions to use these Graph APIs in a Teams app.
 
    This step-by-step guide helps you to set up Teams calling and meeting bot. You can see the following output after you've completed this guide:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |   
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the latest version, install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place. |
     | &nbsp; | [Windows PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install) | Install by executing all the commands. |

     > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    Register an application using app registration in the Microsoft Azure portal for your app to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph API. Following are the steps:

    1. Create a ngrok tunnel to the endpoints of your web server.
    1. Create Azure bot resource to register bot with Azure bot service.
    1. Create client secret that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    1. Create a policy for a demo tenant user for creating online meetings using PowerShell.
    1. Add API permissions for downstream calls.
    1. Create bot channel registration in Azure account.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    **Create ngrok tunnel**

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **Create bot channel registration in Azure account**

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. Search for **Azure Bot** in the search box.
    1. Select **Azure Bot**.
    1. Select **Create**.

         :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/calls-and-meetings/azure-bot_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Bot with Create option highlighted in red.":::
      
       **Create an Azure Bot** window appears.

    1. Enter bot handle name in **Bot handle** field.
    1. Select your **Subscription** and **Resource group** from the dropdown list.
        
         :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/calls-and-meetings/create-azure-bot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create an Azure bot with Subscription and Resource group highlighted in red.":::
      
       You can also create a new resource group. Select **Create new** and then enter the resource name. Select **OK**.
    
    1. Select the required location from **New resource group location** dropdown list, if you've created a new resource group.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/bots/newresource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of New resource group location with location highlighted in red.":::

    1. Select **Type of App** as **Multi Tenant**.

    1. Select **Review + create**.

         :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/calls-and-meetings/review-create_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create an Azure Bot with Multi Tenant and Review + create highlighted in red.":::

    1. If the validation is passed, select **Create**.

         :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/calls-and-meetings/validation_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create an Azure Bot that shows the Validation Passed status and the Create option highlighted in red.":::

      It takes a few moments for your bot service to be provisioned.

          > [!TIP]
          > Save the **Client secrets** **Value** or app password for future reference.

    **Create a policy for a demo tenant user to create online meetings using the following PowerShell script**:

    1. Run Windows PowerShell PSI as an administrator and execute the script.

        ```PowerShell
        New-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "<<policy-identity/policy-name>>" -AppIds "<<azure-client-id>>" -Description "Policy-description"
        Grant-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -PolicyName "<<policy-identity/policy-name>>" -Identity "<<object-id-of-the-user-to-whom-policy-need-to-be-granted>>"
        ```
     
        > [!NOTE]
        > If you are using the Windows PowerShell PSI for the first time, execute the following commands:
        >   * Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
        >   * Run Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams -Force -AllowClobber 

     1. Replace the following in **Windows PowerShell** script:

        |Field | Description |
        |----------------|-----------------|
        |policy-identity/policy-name | Name of the policy. |
        |azure-client-id | Microsoft App ID, which you generated while registering the app in Azure portal. |
        |Policy-description | Description of the policy. |
        |object-id-of-the-user-to-whom-policy-need-to-be-granted |  ID of the user for whom you need to generate the policy using the graph explorer. |

     1. To generate object ID, sign in to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph) using the credentials to whom the policy must be granted.
     1. Select **Graph Explorer** from the tool bar.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/graph-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Graph with graph explorer highlighted in red.":::

     1. Execute the PowerShell script. 
     
     1. Run `Connect-MicrosoftTeams` and sign-in with the credentials to whom the policy has to be granted.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/sign-in-powershell-prompts.png" alt-text="screenshot of Windows PowerShell PSI displaying the sign in prompt.":::

     1. Run the following command in PowerShell to verify whether the policy is created successfully or not. Replace the policy name with your defined policy name.

        ```PowerShell
        Get-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity “<<policy-identity/policy-name>>”
        ```

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/powershell-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Windows PowerShell ISE with Account details highlighted in red." lightbox="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/powershell-tenant-id.png":::
